# Bank Loan Classification | The Lending Club Assignment

## Problem Statement

**GOAL:** Compare different investment strategies on the different credit grades and assess their profitability based on 
default rates, interest returns, and risk exposure. Your goal is to determine the optimal strategy to maximize 
returns while effectively managing risk.


## Data Preparation
1. Load the dataset “Loan_Lending_Club.csv” and conduct an initial exploration of the 
data.
2. Handle missing values appropriately.
3. Determine which categorical variables should be included in the model based on their 
predictive value.
4. Explore ways to preprocess date columns to improve predictive modeling.
5. Analyze correlations between numerical features and select appropriate independent 
variables for the model.
6. Perform feature engineering (feature selection, feature transformation, feature 
creation, and evaluation)?
7. Apply necessary data transformations, such as normalization or standardization. 



## Scoring
1. Identify the most relevant performance metrics (e.g., precision, recall) for evaluating 
your model.
2. Generate a confusion matrices for the different models.
3. Interpret the models’ results, focusing on key insights and implications (based on the 
different investment strategies).
